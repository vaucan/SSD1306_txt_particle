# SSD1306_txt_particle
A text-only library for Particle Core/Photons for interfacing the SSD1306 driver/controller of OLED/PLED displays. The code allows the user to use different fonts (of different sizes), although the font is only selectable at compile time. Currently, a 8x8 font is implemented.

This library uses the init() function of Sonal Pinto's SSD1306 routines, to be found here:
